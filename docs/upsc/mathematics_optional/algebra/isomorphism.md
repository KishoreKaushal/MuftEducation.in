## Group Homomorphism

A homomorphism $\phi$ from a group $G$ to a group $\overline{G}$ is a mapping
from $G$ into $\overline{G}$ that preserves the group operation; that is, $\phi(a b)=$ $\phi(a) \phi(b)$ for all $a, b$ in $G$.

## Isomorphism

Special case of Homomorphism where $\phi$ (*called as an isomorphism)* is one-to-one and onto. If there is an isomorphism between $G$ onto $\overline{G}$, we say that $G$ and $\overline{G}$ are isomorphic and write $G \approx \overline{G}$.

It is implicit in the definition of isomorphism that isomorphic
groups have the same order. 

Obviously $\phi^{-1}$ is as well an isomorphism.

**Examples:**

* Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $Z$. Indeed, if $a$ is a generator of the cyclic group, the mapping $a^{k} \rightarrow k$ is an
  isomorphism. Any finite cyclic group $\langle a\rangle$ of order $n$ is isomorphic to $Z_{n}$ under the mapping $a^{k} \rightarrow k \bmod n .$ That these correspondences are functions and are one-to-one is the essence of Theorem 4.1. Obviously,
  the mappings are onto. That the mappings are operation-preserving
  follows from Exercise 9 in Chapter 0 in the finite case and from the
  definitions in the infinite case.
