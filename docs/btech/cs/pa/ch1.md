## Evaluation Scheme 

* Q1, Q2 - 20%
* Assignments - 15%
* Endsem - 45%
  
## Complexity Class $P$

* $P$ is the set of all decision problems solvable in polynomial time 
* $O(n^c)$ time for some constant c where n is the input size

## Complexity Class $EXP$

* $EXP$ is the set of all decision problems solvable in exponential time 
* $O(2^{n^c})$ time for some constant c where n is the input size
